Hello!

After starting a new chapter in my life, I'm returning to something I last did six years ago. When I began my threat intelligence career in 2019, I had to delete my OSINT and SOCMINT blog posts. Since then, I haven't shared anything publicly, but I've decided to start writing again. The main reason is that information sharing in the community has decreased significantly, and I miss the old-school forum culture (everyone just talking about AI nowadays). I've decided to write occasionally about topics I find interesting. My posts will usually be guides focused on intelligence, threat intel, and malware analysis.
